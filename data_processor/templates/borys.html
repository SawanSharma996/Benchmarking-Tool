<h5>How to Start Accept/Reject Analysis</h5>
<p>Follow these steps to analyze companies using the Accept/Reject matrix.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Set Analysis Criteria:</strong> Before starting the analysis, set your criteria for what should be accepted
		or rejected. Click on 'Accept/Reject Criteria' to specify your preferences.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Choose Companies:</strong> First, pick the companies you want to evaluate. You can select them one by one or
		use the 'Evaluate All' option to pick every company listed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Start Evaluation:</strong> With your companies and criteria set, press 'Evaluate Selected' to begin. If
		you're eveluating all companies, use the 'Evaluate All' option instead.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Update Data:</strong> After starting the analysis, the process might take a while. Use the 'Update' button
		to refresh and get the latest results.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to review the analysis outcomes carefully and adjust your criteria as needed for future analyses.</p>
